<p class="center"><u>ORDER</u> </p>
<p class="indent">An order of the Radiography Examining Board to amend RAD 4.01 (1) and 4.02 (1); and to repeal and recreate RAD 4.01 (2) and 4.02 (2), relating to scope of practice. </p>
<p class="indent">Analysis prepared by the Department of Safety and Professional Services. </p>
<p class="center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="indent"><u>ANALYSIS</u> <b>Statutes interpreted:</b> Section 462.02, Stats. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Statutory authority:</b> Sections 15.08 (5) (b) and 227.11 (2) (a), Stats. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Explanation of agency authority: </b></p>
<p class="indent">Section 15.08 (5) (b), Stats., provides each examining board "[s]hall promulgate rules for its own guidance and for the guidance of the trade or profession to which it pertains. . ." </p>
<p class="indent">Section 227.11 (2) (a), Stats., sets forth the parameters of an agency's rule-making authority, providing " [e]ach agency may promulgate rules interpreting provisions of any statute enforced or administered by the agency. . .but a rule is not valid if the rule exceeds the bounds of correct interpretation." </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Related statute or rule: </b>Chapter 462, Stats., and chs. RAD 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Plain language analysis: </b></p>
<p class="indent">The scope of practice standards for radiographers and limited X-ray machine operators in current rules are a reproduction of the standards for scope of practice established by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) in 2017. ASRT periodically updates its standards, most recently in 2019. The proposed rule updates the scope of practice standards in ss. RAD 4.01 and 4.02 to be a reproduction of the standards for scope of practice established by the ASRT in 2019. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Summary of, and comparison with, existing or proposed federal regulation:</b> None. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Comparison with rules in adjacent states: </b> </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Illinois</b>: Illinois Administrative Code (32 Ill. Admin. Code 401) provides for accreditation in the practice of medical radiation technology in Illinois, but does not explicitly define scope of practice. However, scope of practice is addressed in definitions of the categories of accreditation in the practice of medical radiation technology and the techniques of applying radiation (32 Ill. Admin. Code 401.20). These definitions do not reference the standards established by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Iowa</b>: Iowa Administrative Code (641 IAC 42) provides for permits to operate ionizing radiation producing machines or administer radioactive materials in Iowa, but does not explicitly define scope of practice. However, scope of practice is addressed in definitions of the categories of permits to practice and the techniques of using ionizing radiation producing machines and administering radioactive materials (641 IAC 42.2). In addition, the rules provide the scope within which a limited radiologic technologist with categories of chest, spine, extremities, shoulder, and pediatric shall perform radiography (641 IAC 42.9).The rules do not reference the standards established by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Michigan</b>: The State of Michigan does not license operators of X-ray machines, nor does it have any requirements relative to the licensure or credentialing of X-ray machine operators except for radiologic technologists who perform mammographic examinations (Mich Admin Code, R 333.5630). These rules do not define or otherwise address scope of practice. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Minnesota: </b>Minnesota Statutes (2020 Minn. Stat. 144.121, Subds. 5a. and 5b.) provide the scope </p>
<p class="indent">of practice of a limited X-ray machine operator (LXMO) and a means of granting a variance to a facility for the scope of practice of an LXMO. The statutes do not reference the standards established by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Summary of factual data and analytical methodologies: </b></p>
<p class="indent">The proposed rules update the scope of practice of radiographers and limited X-ray machine operators to align with the current standards for scope of practice established by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. No additional factual data or analytical methodologies were used to develop the proposed rules. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Analysis and supporting documents used to determine effect on small business or in preparation of economic impact analysis:</b> </p>
<p class="indent">The proposed rules were posted for a period of 14 days to solicit public comment on the economic impact of the proposed rule, including how this proposed rule may affect businesses, local government units, and individuals. No comments were received. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fiscal Estimate and Economic Impact Analysis: </b></p>
<p class="indent">The Fiscal Estimate and Economic Impact Analysis are Attached. </p>
<p class="indent"><b>Effect on small business</b>: </p>
<p class="indent">These proposed rules do not have an economic impact on small businesses, as defined in s. 227.114 (1), Stats. The Department's Regulatory Review Coordinator may be contacted by email at Daniel.Hereth@wisconsin.gov, or by calling (608) 267-2435. <b>Agency contact person</b>: </p>
