SYNOPSIS OF SUBJECT MATTER OF THE REGULATION</p><p class="indent">Pursuant to 14 Del.C. ยง 122(b)(18), the Delaware Department of Education ("Department") developed an amendment to 14 DE Admin. Code 915 James H. Groves High School. The regulation provides for the operation of James H. Groves High School, an adult education high school. In June 2021, subsection 2.2 of the regulation was amended concerning the age of a student in the In School Credit Program. The amendment specified that it would be in effect until June 30, 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department has determined that the change should remain in effect for the 2022-23 school year and, as a result, it has proposed to strike the date of "June 30, 2022" from subsection 2.2.</p><p class="indent">Persons wishing to present their views regarding this matter may do so in writing by submitting them to the Department of Education, Office of the Secretary, Attn: Regulation Review, 401 Federal Street, Suite 2, Dover, Delaware 19901 or through the Department's online submission form at https://education.delaware.gov/community/delaware-education-laws-and-regulations/provide-public-comment/ by the close of business (4:30 p.m. EST) on or before June 3, 2022.

Such regulation is proposed by the Secretary of Education and subject to the approval of the State Board of Education.</p><p class="indent">8.

The amended regulation is consistent with, and not an impediment to, the implementation of other state educational policies, and in particular to state educational policies addressing achievement in the core academic subjects of mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies.</p><p class="indent">9. Is there a less burdensome method for addressing the purpose of the amended regulation?
