<p class="indent">REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT</p>
<p class="indent">Contact Person: Jenny Gilbert</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Provide a brief summary of:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) What this administrative regulation does:</p>
<p class="indent">This administrative regulation establishes size limits, daily creel limits, and possession limits for sport fish that may be taken from Kentucky waters.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The necessity of this administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">This administrative regulation is necessary to properly manage the sport fish populations of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes:</p>
<p class="indent">KRS 150.025(1) authorizes the Department to promulgate administrative regulations to establish seasons for the taking of fish and wildlife, to regulate creel limits and methods of take, and to make these requirements apply to a limited area. KRS 150.470 authorizes the department to establish creel and size limits for fish.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes:</p>
<p class="indent">This administrative regulation will assist in the effective administration of the statutes by limiting the number and size of fish that may be taken from Kentucky's waters. This will ensure that Kentucky's valuable sport fish populations are maintained at high levels.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">This amendment will help standardize and simplify black bass regulation across the state by better grouping lakes into standardized regulation blocks. Thirty-two water bodies were standardized across six different regulation options including: statewide regulation, 12- to 15-inch slot limit for largemouth bass only, 12- to 15-inch slot limit for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass, 15-inch size limit and 6-fish creel for largemouth bass, 15-inch size limit and 6-fish creel for largemouth and smallmouth bass, and a 15-inch size limit and 6 fish creel on three river watersheds. In addition, special trout regulations were removed from Poor Fork of the Cumberland River and Paintsville Lake Tailwater, Swift Camp Creek catch-and-release regulations were standardized with all other catch and release trout streams, a special size and creel regulation was placed on channel and blue catfish at Carr Creek Lake, and all four reservoirs containing muskie were standardized to a 40-inch size limit.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">This amendment is necessary to protect the largemouth bass populations across the state and better standardize and simplify regulations. In addition, simplification of trout regulations and better protection of catfish at Carr Creek Lake and muskie at four reservoirs was needed.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes:</p>
<p class="indent">See 1(c) above.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes:</p>
<p class="indent">See 1(d) above.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">All anglers fishing at the water bodies and for the species identified in 2(a) above will be affected.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in question (3) will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, if it is an amendment, including:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) List the actions that each of the regulated entities identified in question (3) will have to take to comply with this administrative regulation or amendment:</p>
<p class="indent">Anglers will need to comply with the regulation changes identified in 2(a).</p>
<p class="indent">(b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities identified in question (3):</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no cost incurred by the anglers identified.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the entities identified in question (3):</p>
<p class="indent">Anglers who fish at the water bodies and for the species identified in 2(a) above will benefit in the long run from a higher quality sport fishery, improved angling opportunities, and easier to understand regulations.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Initially:</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no initial cost to implement this administrative regulation.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) On a continuing basis:</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no additional cost on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation:</p>
<p class="indent">The source of funding is the State Game and Fish Fund.</p>
<p class="indent">(7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to implement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment:</p>
<p class="indent">It will not be necessary to increase a fee or funding to implement this administrative regulation.</p>
<p class="indent">(8) State whether or not this administrative regulation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees:</p>
<p class="indent">This administrative regulation does not establish any fees nor does it indirectly increase any fees.</p>
<p class="indent">(9) TIERING: Is tiering applied?</p>
<p class="indent">Tiering was not applied because all individuals fishing in Kentucky must abide by the same requirements. </p>
<p class="indent">FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT</p>
<p class="indent">(1) What units, parts or divisions of state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation?</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal regulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the administrative regulation.</p>
<p class="indent">KRS 150.025(1) authorizes the Department to promulgate administrative regulations to regulate bag, creel, and possession limits of game and fish. KRS 150.470 authorizes the department to promulgate creel and size limits for fish.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Estimate the effect of this administrative regulation on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect.</p>
<p class="indent">(a) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first year?</p>
<p class="indent">It is unknown if this administrative regulation could indirectly increase any fishing license sales during the first year.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subsequent years?</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no direct revenue generated in subsequent years, and it is unknown if fishing license sales will be indirectly increased because of this amendment.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) How much will it cost to administer this program for the first year?</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no initial cost to implement this administrative regulation for the first year.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) How much will it cost to administer this program for subsequent years?</p>
<p class="indent">There will be no cost in subsequent years.</p>
<p class="indent">Note: If specific dollar estimates cannot be determined, provide a brief narrative to explain the fiscal impact of the administrative regulation.</p>
