   REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal">
   Contact Person: Jenny Gilbert
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">
   (1) Provide a brief summary of:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (a) What this administrative regulation does:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   This administrative regulation establishes size limits, daily creel limits, and possession limits for sport fish that may be taken from Kentucky waters.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   This administrative regulation is necessary to properly manage the sport fish populations of Kentucky.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   KRS 150.025(1) authorizes the Department to promulgate administrative regulations to establish seasons for the taking of fish and wildlife, to regulate creel limits and methods of take, and to make these requirements apply to a limited area. KRS 150.470 authorizes the department to establish creel and size limits for fish.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   This administrative regulation will assist in the effective administration of the statutes by limiting the number and size of fish that may be taken from Kentucky's waters. This will ensure that Kentucky's valuable sport fish populations are maintained at high levels.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">
   (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   This amendment will help standardize and simplify black bass regulation across the state by better grouping lakes into standardized regulation blocks. Thirty-two water bodies were standardized across six different regulation options including: statewide regulation, 12- to 15-inch slot limit for largemouth bass only, 12- to 15-inch slot limit for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass, 15-inch size limit and 6-fish creel for largemouth bass, 15-inch size limit and 6-fish creel for largemouth and smallmouth bass, and a 15-inch size limit and 6 fish creel on three river watersheds. In addition, special trout regulations were removed from Poor Fork of the Cumberland River and Paintsville Lake Tailwater, Swift Camp Creek catch-and-release regulations were standardized with all other catch and release trout streams, a special size and creel regulation was placed on channel and blue catfish at Carr Creek Lake, and all four reservoirs containing muskie were standardized to a 40-inch size limit.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
   This amendment is necessary to protect the largemouth bass populations across the state and better standardize and simplify regulations. In addition, simplification of trout regulations and better protection of catfish at Carr Creek Lake and muskie at four reservoirs was needed.
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.4in">
   (c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes:
  </p>
  <p class="KARNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
